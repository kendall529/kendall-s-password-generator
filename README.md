# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

A password generator structured off of the class starter files and then turned functional through the addition of JavaScript. Click the "Generate Password" button and then you will be asked a series of prompts for how you want your password to look. You can decide on a length of characters ranging from 8-128 and the type of characters you want such as numbers, symbols, capital and or lowercase letters.
